# dotfiles

All of my configuration files -- typically dot variety, but might be other files that configure things.

## iTerm2 Theme

I use [Tokyo Night][tn] as my theme.

By default it loads a customized version of [Operator Mono][om] w/ all the [Nerd Font][nf] fixings. If you want to use this same version, [patch your own version][patch] of Operator Mono with Nerd Fonts.
