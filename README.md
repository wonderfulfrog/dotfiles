# dotfiles

All of my configuration files -- typically dot variety, but might be other files that configure things.

## Color schemes

I use [Tokyo Night][tn] as my theme wherever possible, and [Operator Mono][om] as my typeface. If you want to use the same version, [patch your own version][patch] of Operator Mono with [Nerd Fonts][nf].

[nf]: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts
